- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Add Admin module tabs and implement requested sections (Solicitudes, Viaticos y retroactivos, Rendiciones, Pagos y correcciones, Reporte) with correct data, filters, and actions per spec.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow `AGENTS.md` repo rules and continuity ledger process.
  - Keep changes small; no new dependencies.
  - Use existing Next.js router style, Tailwind, and DB layer in repo.
  - Spanish copy for UI.
- Key decisions:
  - Lote corrections in Pagos y correcciones update the latest version in place (no new version).
- State:
  - Admin module refactor continuing; report module renamed to Tesoreria and Excel exports updated.
- Done:
  - Read `AGENTS.md` and current `CONTINUITY.md`.
  - Added Admin module tab layout and split content by section.
  - Added retroactive apply action and worker balance view in Admin tab.
  - Added rendiciones data model, actions, UI form, and export route.
  - Updated Admin page to await async searchParams.
  - Added Admin payment actions (registrar pago + corregir lote) in Pagos y correcciones.
  - Removed Tesoreria from main navigation and adjusted home/flow messaging.
  - Grouped rendiciones by lote with total amount and workers list in Admin.
  - Added bulk rendition form to apply same data to multiple collaborators.
  - Added Solo pendientes/Todos toggle for bulk rendiciones selection.
  - Added rendicion status filter and removed per-worker forms from rendiciones.
  - Lote corrections now reset status to PENDING_SIGNATURE and remove existing signature.
  - Modals close after actions complete across admin/solicitudes/tesoreria flows.
  - Added modal body scroll and solicitud submission confirmation message.
  - Renamed "Estandarizar" action to "Colocar lote" in Administracion.
  - Removed "Estados clave" and "Base de datos activa" cards from Panel.
  - Renamed Reportes module to Tesoreria in navigation and Admin tab.
  - Updated report exports to Excel-compatible .xls output.
- Now:
  - Verify Tesoreria label appears in navigation and report downloads open in Excel.
- Next:
  - Validate payment/corrections flow and retroactive apply after changes.
  - Add any missing polish or tests once schema migration is decided.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - Required Excel report format/fields beyond "viaticos pagados".
  - Should retroactive apply mark batches/items as PAID or move to READY_FOR_PAYMENT?
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - `src/app/administracion/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/administracion/RenditionForm.tsx`
  - `src/app/actions/rates.ts`
