- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Add worker creation from Colaboradores, Spanish CSV headers, and tighter Admin cards layout.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow `AGENTS.md` repo rules and continuity ledger process.
  - Keep changes small; no new dependencies.
  - Next.js App Router + Tailwind + Prisma already in use.
- Key decisions:
  - Re-encode offending source files to UTF-8 when invalid bytes are found.
- State:
  - Implemented Colaboradores create modal, Spanish CSV headers, and denser Admin layout.
- Done:
  - Fixed Vercel build by running `prisma generate` during build and removing BOMs.
  - Added worker creation CTA to Colaboradores.
  - Translated CSV headers to Spanish for report exports.
  - Reworked Admin layout to reduce whitespace and bring table up.
- Now:
  - Quick UI/copy pass on new changes.
- Next:
  - Validate UI flows and export outputs.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - src/app/colaboradores/page.tsx
  - src/app/reportes/export/pagos/route.ts
  - src/app/reportes/export/solicitudes/route.ts
