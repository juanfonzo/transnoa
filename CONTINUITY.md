- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Fix Vercel build failure by removing invalid UTF-8 bytes so `npm run build` succeeds.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow `AGENTS.md` repo rules and continuity ledger process.
  - Keep changes small; no new dependencies.
  - Next.js App Router + Tailwind + Prisma already in use.
- Key decisions:
  - Re-encode offending source files to UTF-8 when invalid bytes are found.
- State:
  - Re-encoded `src/app/solicitudes/SolicitudWizard.tsx` to UTF-8 (no BOM); scan shows no invalid UTF-8 in `src`.
- Done:
  - Read AGENTS and current ledger.
  - Normalized `src/app/solicitudes/SolicitudWizard.tsx` encoding to UTF-8.
  - Scanned `src` for invalid UTF-8 bytes (none found).
- Now:
  - Confirm build succeeds after encoding fix.
- Next:
  - Re-run build (or provide steps) to confirm error is resolved.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - src/app/solicitudes/SolicitudWizard.tsx
  - npm run build
