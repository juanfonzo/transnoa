- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Fix Vercel build failure by removing BOM/invalid bytes in `package.json` so build succeeds.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow `AGENTS.md` repo rules and continuity ledger process.
  - Keep changes small; no new dependencies.
  - Next.js App Router + Tailwind + Prisma already in use.
- Key decisions:
  - Re-encode offending source files to UTF-8 when invalid bytes are found.
- State:
  - Build now failing on Vercel due to BOM in `package.json` (Unexpected token '﻿').
- Done:
  - Read AGENTS and current ledger.
  - Normalized `src/app/solicitudes/SolicitudWizard.tsx` encoding to UTF-8.
  - Scanned `src` for invalid UTF-8 bytes (none found).
  - Re-encoded `package.json` to UTF-8 (no BOM).
- Now:
  - Confirm build succeeds after `package.json` encoding fix.
- Next:
  - Re-run build (or provide steps) to confirm error is resolved.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - package.json
  - npm run build
