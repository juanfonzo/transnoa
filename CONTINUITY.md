- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Support per-day worker assignment with multiple concepts per day and allow creating workers from Solicitudes.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Follow `AGENTS.md` repo rules and continuity ledger process.
  - Must include 4 roles in demo.
  - Demo uses role selector cookie/session, no credentials.
  - Keep changes consistent with existing Tailwind setup; no new deps.
- Key decisions:
  - Store per-day plan in request payload JSON and generate day concepts + worker day counts from it.
- State:
  - Wizard and server action updated for day-based assignments; worker creation modal added.
- Done:
  - Updated Solicitud wizard with day plan step and per-day worker/concept assignments.
  - Added createWorker server action and worker creation modal.
  - Server action now builds worker days and day concepts from day plan.
- Now:
  - Validate wizard flow end-to-end with new worker and day plan logic.
- Next:
  - Optional: expose day plan summary in Solicitudes detail view.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - src/app/solicitudes/SolicitudWizard.tsx
  - src/app/actions/requests.ts
  - src/app/actions/workers.ts
  - src/app/solicitudes/WorkerCreateModal.tsx
